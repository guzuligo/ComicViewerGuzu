--How this application functions--

This is a comic viewer application. It takes a JSON file and converts it into a comic.
All assets are in "asset" folder.
It is a one HTML file that contains all the code. It runs on client side. No server is required.

The comic contains pages. Each page is displayed alone. 
Each page contains elements. Elements could be an image, sound effect, or background music.
If you navigate to next page, everything on page will be removed and replaced with new page content. But here are some exceptions:
    -If an element is marked to stay for several pages, example (From page 5 to 10), then that element won't unload while in range. 
        An example use case is background images, foreground frame and background music.



Following is the JSON file config used to create the page. There should be a function called loadJSON to load the comic and starts it on first page.
